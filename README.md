Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client is a high or low risk for loan approval using machine learning models. The dataset includes various features such as age, income, and financial behaviors.

Data
The dataset contains the following columns:

ID: Unique identifier for each client
Age: Age of the client
Income: Annual income of the client
Married/Single: Marital status of the client
House_Ownership: Home ownership status
Car_Ownership: Car ownership status
Profession: Profession of the client
CITY: City of residence
STATE: State of residence
Risk_Flag: Target variable (1 if high risk, 0 if low risk)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. Visualizations were created using seaborn and matplotlib to show distributions, correlations, and insights into the data.

Model Building
Several machine learning models were built and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feature Importance
Feature importance was analyzed to understand the main factors influencing the risk prediction. The most important features were Income, Age, and Profession.

Results and Evaluation
The best-performing model was the Random Forest Classifier, which achieved the highest accuracy and balanced performance across other metrics.
